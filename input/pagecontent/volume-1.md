The Query for Existing Data for Mobile (QEDm) Profile supports dynamic
queries for clinical data elements, including observations, allergy and
intolerances, problems, diagnostic results, medications, immunizations,
procedures, encounters and provenance by making the information widely
available to other systems within and across enterprises to support
provision of better clinical care. It defines a transaction used to
query a list of specific data elements, persisted as FHIR resources.

QEDm is functionally equivalent to the QED Profile (based on HL7v3), but
QEDm is better suited for implementation by application on mobile
devices or where the http/REST technology is preferred. The term
"mobile" must be understood in a wide sense: it refers not only to
applications on devices used for mobility that are resource- and
platform-constrained. (e.g., tablets, smartphones, and embedded devices
including home-health devices), but also to larger systems deployed in
environments where interoperability requirements are simple, such as
pulling the latest summary for display.

The QEDm Profile defines a standardized interface to health (HTTP-based RESTful APIs) suited for
deployment of mobile applications on resource-constrained devices with
simple programming environment (e.g., JavaScript), simple protocol stack
(e.g., HTTP), and simple display functionality (e.g., HTML browser). The
goal is to limit required additional libraries that are often necessary
to process SOAP, MIME-Multipart, MTOM/XOP Web Services.

The QEDm Profile uses the already defined actors Clinical Data Consumer and Clinical Data Source,
for which it specifies option and a transaction to be used for querying
a list of specific data elements, persisted as FHIR resources. The
current version of Supplement doesnâ€™t consider the reconciliation of the
fine-grained data elements gathered by the Clinical Data Source and/or
Clinical Data Consumer Actors. In order to perform reconciliation a
grouping with RECON Reconciliation Agent SHOULD be considered.

The QEDm Profile MAY also be deployed in conjunction with document
sharing profiles such as MHD or XDS Profiles. The Provenance
Option in QEDm is used in particular by the mXDE Profile to address the
combined deployment of QEDm for access to fine-grained data element with
links to source documents accessible through the MHD or XDS Profiles.

## 1:8.4 QEDm Overview

### 1:8.4.1 Concepts

The QEDm Profile supports a broad set of the QED use cases and
functionality while keeping the implementation as simple as possible.

### 1:8.4.2 Use Cases

#### 1:8.4.2.1 Use Case #1: Discovery and Retrieval of Existing Data Elements

##### 1:8.4.2.1.1 Discovery and Retrieval of Existing Data Elements Description

In this use case, the patient, by using a mobile device, needs access to
existing data elements. For example, a mobile application involved in a workflow needs to
discover all the current Observations and Medications.

##### 1:8.4.2.1.2 Discovery and Retrieval of Existing Data Elements Process Flow

The Mobile Query Existing Data transaction is used to provide
parameterized queries that result in a list of returned data elements.

<figure>
{%include usecase1-processflow.svg%}
<figcaption><b>Figure 1:8.4.2.1.2-1: Use Case #1 Process Flow in QEDm Profile</b></figcaption>
</figure>
<br clear="all">

#### 1:8.4.2.2 Use Case #2: Discovery and Retrieval of Existing Data Elements with Source Document Links

##### 1:8.4.2.2.1 Discovery and Retrieval of Existing Data Elements with Source Document Links Description

In this use case, the physician, by using a mobile device, needs to
access all existing data elements and eventually to retrieve and consume
the source documents, if any.

For example, a mobile application involved in a workflow needs to
discover all Encounters which the patient has participated in and, for
those of interest, it needs to retrieve and show the related document
where the Encounter was originally specified.

##### 1:8.4.2.2.2 Discovery and Retrieval of Existing Data Elements with Source Document Links Process Flow

The Mobile Query Existing Data [PCC-44](PCC-44.html)transaction is used to provide
parameterized queries that result in a returned data elements.
One of the query options specifies that provenance information be
included in the result to obtain the links to source documents, if any.

A Clinical Data Source that supports the Provenance Option
may be grouped with the [Mobile Cross-Enterprise Document Data Element Extraction (mXDE)]({{site.data.fhir.iheitimxde}}/index.html) Data Element Extractor [Actor]({{site.data.fhir.iheitimxde}}/volume-1.html#145111-data-element-extractor) and thus will expose [mXDE defined Provenance]({{site.data.fhir.iheitimxde}}/StructureDefinition-IHE.ITI.mXDE.Provenance.html) resources.

The mobile application implements The Clinical Data Consumer to perform
the query and can use the Provenance to get to the Documents from which those Resources were found.

The mobile application implements an MHD Document Consumer and
retrieves the document from the MHD Document Responder by using the
related returned document link.

## 1:8.5 QEDm Security Considerations

See ITI TF-2: [Appendix Z.8 "Mobile Security Considerations"](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ch-Z.html#z.8-mobile-security-considerations).

The QEDm Profile provides an API for accessing Data Element level
details that are identifiable to a specific Patient. Thus, all the data
communicated, including the query parameters, SHOULD be considered
Patient Identifiable data. The grouping with [Internet User Authorization (IUA)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/IUA/index.html), or some similar User
Authentication and Authorization solution, is critical to enforcing
Privacy and Security. All accesses to this data SHOULD be recorded as
audit log for security surveillance and Privacy reporting. These topics
are discussed in Appendix Z.8 with recommendations.

The Provenance Option adds an additional protection against
Data Integrity and Data Authenticity risks. The Provenance record
associated with a Data Element returned by the Clinical Data Source
would indicate the source of the data. In the case where Provenance is
specific to a Document, grouping with MHD Document Consumer or XDS
Document Consumer enables the retrieval of that source Document. The
mXDE Profile ITI TF-1: 45.5 Security Considerations includes further
discussion on the specific Security Considerations of bridging between a
Document Sharing environment and a Data Element access model.

<a name="other-grouping"> </a>

## 1:8.6 QEDm Cross-Profile Considerations

### 1:8.6.1 ITI mXDE â€“ Mobile Cross-Enterprise Document Data Element Extraction

A Clinical Data Source MAY be grouped with a [Data Element Extractor]({{site.data.fhir.iheitimxde}}/index.html)
which requires the addition of necessary provenance information to
ensure consistency within each returned data element.

This grouping allows the extraction of data elements and the addition of
references to data origins (e.g., Documents) used in generating the
result.

A Clinical Data Consumer MAY be grouped with a Data Element Provenance
Consumer to extract the identifiers (provenance information) that
consistently link the returned data elements to the related data origin.

### 1:8.6.2 ITI PIX - Patient Identity Cross Referencing and ITI PDQ - Patient Demographics Query

A Clinical Data Consumer MAY be grouped with 
a [Patient Identifier Cross-reference]({{site.data.fhir.ihepixm}}/index.html) Consumer or 
a [Patient Demographics Consumer]({{site.data.fhir.ihepdqm}}/index.html) to resolve
patient identifiers prior to submitting queries to a Clinical Data
Source.

Within an enterprise, the need to cross-reference patient identifiers
MAY not be necessary. However, once enterprise boundaries are crossed,
these identifiers will need to be resolved. In that case profiles such
as PIX, PIXm, PDQ and/or PDQm MAY be used.

### 1:8.6.3 ITI MHD â€“ Mobile Health Documents

A Clinical Data Source MAY be grouped with 
an [Mobile Access to Health Documents (MHD)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/index.html) Document Responder.
Data gathered from clinical documents submitted to the Document
Responder can be a source of information returned by the Clinical Data
Source. It MAY include references to documents used in generating the
QEDm returned data-elements, by using the FHIR Provenance Resource.

A Clinical Data Consumer MAY be grouped with an MHD Document Consumer.
The Clinical Data Consumer MAY use the references to access the source
documents.

### 1:8.6.4 ITI XDS - Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing

A Clinical Data Source MAY be grouped with 
an [Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (XDS)](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-10.html) Document Repository.
Data gathered from clinical documents submitted to the Document
Repository can be a source of information returned by the Clinical Data
Source. Information returned by the Clinical Data Source MAY include
references to all documents used in generating the results, by using the
FHIR Provenance Resource.

### 1:8.6.5 Content Integration Profiles

A Content Creator MAY be grouped with a Clinical Data Consumer to obtain
some or all of the information necessary to create a Medical Summary
based on information found in a Clinical Data Source.

A Content Creator MAY be grouped with a Clinical Data Source. When
grouped with a Content Creator, the Clinical Data Source SHALL respond
to queries containing the relevant vocabulary codes used by the Content
Creator.
