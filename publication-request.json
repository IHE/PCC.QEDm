    "introduction" : "The Query for Existing Data for Mobile Profile (QEDm) supports dynamic queries for clinical data elements, including observations, allergy and intolerances, problems, diagnostic results, medications, immunizations, procedures, encounters and provenance by making the information widely available to other systems within and across enterprises to support provision of better clinical care. It defines a transaction used to query a list of specific data elements, persisted as FHIR resources."
